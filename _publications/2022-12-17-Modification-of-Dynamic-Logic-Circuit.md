<B>Abstract:</B> 
<p style='text-align: justify;'>This paper is based on the OR logic operation’s small discharging current and transmission time delay dynamic logic circuit configuration method. In terms of static logic circuits, it require a larger number of transistors and consume a massive amount of power. However, high-speed dynamic logic circuits consume less power due to their lower number of transistors. But, it has an issue with the evaluation phase where current gets leaked from the dynamic node due to sub-threshold leakage. In this paper, we have shown a new dynamic logic circuit design procedure for reducing leakage current from the dynamic node by using delay component, stacking effect, current mirror circuit with footed nmos, and a keeper circuit with the keeper device. The suggested system is analyzed in LTSpice with 45nm CMOS predictive technology model and compared with the previous research to demonstrate validity. The simulation study demonstrates power savings relative to traditional architecture and verifies the suggested strategy. This circuit could be used for designing low power consuming and delay systems for wide fan-in and can be useful for cascading several stages.</p>
